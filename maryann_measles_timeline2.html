	    Connecticut is the most economically stratified state in the country: on average, a top-1-percent taxpayer in Connecticut earns 40 times more in a year than the state's typical taxpayer, according to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute. In Connecticut, upscale suburbs and urban ghettos often share borders (see: West Hartford and Hartford; Bridgeport and Fairfield), but rarely do the two populations live within the same town limits. But New Milford, Connecticut is different: New Milford is a microcosm of the state's inequality issues. It is a place where the ultra-rich and permantely poor live not quie side-by-side, but a stone's-throw apart -- the town's uppercrust often live on Candlewood Lake or hidden atop wooded hills at the town's edges; the poor are relegated to condo complexes or small, tract houses near the center of town. In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, young, poor kids would hang out in the gazebo on New Milford's Town Green. Many residents called them townies because that's where you could find them. The term townie carried certain connotations: a teenage layabout who accidentally knocks up a girlfriend or gets knocked up, then has to cobble-together work -- usually as unskilled labor like a landscapper or receptionist -- and above all else, a kid that, like their parents and grandparents before them, would never leave New Milford, or at best would move a couple towns over to repeat the cycle. It was to this class that Maryann Measles belonged -- not by choice, but by birthright. And so when she turned 13, she was welcomed into one of the only group where she felt like she belonged and was taken advantage of by older men.
