		    Connecticut is the <a href=”http://www.epi.org/publication/unequal-states/”>most economically stratified state in the country</a>. In the Nutmeg State, upscale suburbs and urban ghettos often share borders (see: West Hartford and Hartford; Bridgeport and Fairfield), but the rich and poor rarely live in the same town. 
		    New Milford is an anomaly in Connecticut -- it is a microcosm of the statewide inequality. In New Milford, the ultra-rich and permanently poor live not quite side-by-side, but a stone's-throw apart: the upper class live on the sprawling coast of Candlewood Lake or hide themselves atop wooded hills at the edge of town; the poor are relegated to condo complexes or small, tract houses near the Village Green, a grass field with a gazebo surrounded by small shops and a movie theater at the center of town. 
		    In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, young, poor kids would hang out in the gazebo on the green. People called them townies because that's where you could find them. The term “townie” carried certain connotations: a code word for teenage layabouts who accidentally knock up their girlfriend or get knocked up; kids that fail out of high school and have to cobble-together work as unskilled laborers -- usually landscapers or receptionists; but above all else, a townie was a kid that, like their parents and grandparents before them, would never leave New Milford, or at best would move a couple towns over, where the cycle would repeat.
		    It was to this class of people that Maryann Measles belonged -- not by choice, but by birthright. When she turned 13, she put down her childish things and entered the only group in New Milford where she would be accepted.
