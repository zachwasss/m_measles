		    Connecticut is the <a href=”http://www.epi.org/publication/unequal-states/”>most economically stratified state in the country</a> -- upscale New York City suburbs and urban ghettos often share borders, but the rich and poor rarely live in the same town.</p>
		    <p>New Milford is an anomaly because the ultra-rich and permanently poor live a stone's-throw apart. The upper class occupy the edges of town -- they live in homes on the banks of Candlewood Lake and atop hills hidden in the woods. The poor live in condo complexes and small, tract houses near the Village Green, a grass field surrounded by small shops and cobblestone sidewalks at the center of town.</p>
		    <p>On the green, there's a gazebo -- it's New Milford's unofficial symbol. Many residents call the kids that hang out in the gazebo, "townies," because that's where you could find them -- in town. The term “townie” carried certain connotations: it was code for a teenage layabout who would most likely accidentally knock up his girlfriend or, for girls, get knocked up; it was a kid that failed or would soon fail out of high school and would end up working as an unskilled laborer like a landscaper or receptionist; but above all, a townie was a kid that, like her parents and grandparents before her, would live in New Milford for the rest of her life -- or, at best, would move a town over, where the cycle would repeat anew.</p>
		   <p>In the late summer of 1997, Maryann Measles beacame a townie -- not by choice, but by birthright. She was 13 and wanted to join the only group in New Milford where she felt like she belonged.</p>
